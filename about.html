    <p>Today, we worked on some circuits, which I found rather difficult. Our job was to attempt to wire the circuit in a way that would allow one of our LED's to light up. As a team, we immediatley turned to Google, which I later learned will become my best friend. We tried a few different websites and videos, but we had no luck. Eventually, a girl from another team came over to help us. Eventually, we discovered we needed to fix our batteries and I realized we should've double checked our batteries in the beginning. In the end, we got our LED to light up and we learned a few lessons along the way.</p>
    <p> My idea of robotics hasn't really changed because I've had some exposure to robotics at a younger age. I still find it a bit challenging while interesting and engaging. The future of robotics makes me very excited because I'm incredly interested in robotics for someone who knows little to nothing about it. Throughout the week, we will be working in groups yet again. One thing I can do better is try to ask questions and engage myself in conversations instead of shutting myself out like I normally do when I don't understand something. </p>

    <p>One thing I leanred about how the internet works is information is distributed in parts, or packets, that move in different directions but, in the end, make it to the desired location at the same time. </p>
    <p>I believe LaTeX is a markup because it is used for simply formatting, which is what a markup is. </p>
    <p>I would like to add pictures and aesthetics to my Django site. I have a lot of information that I'd like to contribute to my site, but an unattractive site isn't something most people like to visit. </p>

    <p>A dynamic feature I would like to learn about next is stuff relating to pictures. For example, I'd like to make a changing collage on my page. That'd be quite lovely. </p>
    <p>I would use a dictionary in favor for a list because they allow for more organization and they allow me to put in keys with ease, outputing more information. </p>

    <p>I'm really proud of figuring out some of the components of algorithms, as well as how they work. The Dijkstra algorithm was my favorite from today because I absolutley love the complexity of it. </p>

    <p>I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around the idea of a social network and how it works. I'd say that was my only real limitation while building my social network. As for the second question, since I don't have a concrete understanding of a social network, I'm not entirely sure what I would add. </p>
    <p>I'm really proud that I was able to solve 100% of my syntax errors. I feel like I'm really improving with both coding and thinking outside the box. Normally I'm very skeptical of myself and I look down on myself, but today helped boost some of my confidence. For final projects, I'm really excited to make something that will help people and further benefit society. </p>
